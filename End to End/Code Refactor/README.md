## TODO List:
- Reseting the consecutive frames with posture warning counter needs to be revistied.
- If that did not fix the "drawing midpoint during warnings" issue visit it separately.
- Store the warning(s) associated with each error region.
- Handle if 100% of the video was an error region.
- Video 22 seconds longd, returns an error region of length 0.
- Reporting Depth and Rate after fixed intervals not once per chunk.
